I'm a retired Microsoft Executive, Amateur Genealogist, Amateur Chess Player, Mentor, Book Author, and proud alum of GHS graduating class of 1975. I am deeply invested in preserving the rich legacy of our beloved school. In the face of its closure in 2016 and impending demolition, it's crucial to ensure that the memories, achievements, and traditions of Great GHS are not forgotten. Through this website, I aim to create a digital archive where alumni, faculty, and community members can come together to reminisce, share stories, and celebrate the lasting impact of our alma mater. Together, let's ensure that the spirit of Great GHS continues to inspire future generations.
